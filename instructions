1 Install Minikube Kubernetes on CentOS 8/7 with KVM
https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-minikube-on-centos-linux-with-kvm/

2 Run following command line in the current directory
Kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml

Here we create container using deploy.yaml file. We can also create the image using Docker and deploy docker image using Kubectl as what it is shown in the blog below

3 To gain access to pod, we need to run following command line (This is a bit like gaining access to EC2 instance in terms of AWS)
kubectl exec --stdin --tty <name of the pod> -- sh


Notes: To find the name of the pod, run command line below
kubectl get pods

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/get-shell-running-container/


Kubectl command lines you should know:

kubectl get all - Get all kubectl information under the default workspace
kubectl get pods - Get all pods information under the default workspace
kubectl get deployments - Get all deployments information under default workspace
kubectl get services - Get all services information under default workspace

Notes: To troubleshoot using kubectl, we use describe not log

kubectl describe pod <name of the pod> - This is most commonly used way to troubleshoot issues facing a pod

Or

You may gain access into the pod to check out the issues
kubectl exec --stdin --tty <name of the pod> -- sh
